# UnityOBBDownloader
This package is an adaption of the Google Play market_downloader library, for use with Unity Android (as a plugin).

This plugin does NOT solve splitting up a >100MB .apk into .obb (through asset bundles or similar techniques).
It merely handles the downloading of .obb files attached to a published .apk, on devices that don't support automatic downloading.

This software is free and published as is, with no warranty and responsibilities - use it at your own risk.

## Usage
This plugin is published as an AAR, and is compatible with Unity 5+. Minimum Android version supported is Honeycomb (API level 11). For a version compatible with Unity 4 or with older Android devices, please checkout changeset tagged `1.0`.
The C# API of the plugin is available in `IGooglePlayObbDownloader` interface. Use `GooglePlayObbDownloadManager.GetGooglePlayObbDownloader()` to obtain an instance.

0.	Add the plugin to your project. You need the AAR and the C# scripts (`Assets/Plugins/Android/unityOBBDownloader.aar`, `Assets/Scripts/GooglePlayDownloader.cs` and `Assets/Scripts/GooglePlayDownloaderImpl.cs`)
1.	In your script, don't forget to set `PublicKey` to your own value. You'll see a message logged and probably a crash if you skip this step
2.	Change the Bundle Identifier / Version Code so it matches the application already available on Google Play (that has .obb files attached)
3.	Build and Run on your Android device

For a script sample, please refer to `Assets/Scripts/DownloadObbExample.cs`.

## How to Build
Run `gradlew makeAARRelease` from src/UnityAndroidPermissions/ (or alternatively excecute build.bat). 
If successfull the AAR file inside src/UnityAndroidPermissions/release/ will be updated.
